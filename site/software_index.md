# üêç Software Installation

To get the most out of this course, it is highly recommended that you reproduce the examples and tutorials provided. This hands-on approach will allow you to better understand the concepts and apply the techniques we cover. To achieve this, you will need to install several software packages on your machine. All of the required software is open-source and available for free.

### Installation Methods

There are two main approaches to installing the required Python libraries on your machine. You can choose the method that best suits your comfort level and technical expertise.

### 1. [Graphical Approach](software/1-graphical.md)

This method is suitable for users who are not familiar with the command line interface and prefer a more visual, step-by-step process for installation. It involves using tools that provide a graphical user interface (GUI) to install the necessary packages.

- **No Command-Line Experience Required**: This approach is ideal for beginners or those who prefer not to work with the command line.
- **Requires More Disk Space**: The graphical installers often include additional software, which means you will need a larger amount of storage space on your machine.
- **Slower Installation Process**: Since it installs additional dependencies, the setup process may take longer compared to the command-line approach.

### 2. [Command-Line Approach](software/2-cli.md)

This method is recommended for users who are comfortable with or willing to learn how to use the command line. It is a more streamlined way to install only the essential software and dependencies for the course.

- **Requires Command-Line Familiarity**: You'll need to work with the terminal or command prompt, but we will provide clear instructions on the necessary commands. Learning this approach can be valuable for future work in programming and data science.
- **Less Disk Space Required**: The command-line approach installs only the necessary components, resulting in a more lightweight setup.
- **Faster Installation Process**: Because it skips installing non-essential extras, this method tends to be quicker.

### Conclusion

Both installation methods will equip you with the required tools for the course. The **graphical approach** is best if you prefer ease of use and don't mind the extra storage space and time required. The **command-line approach** is ideal if you want a faster, more efficient setup and are open to working with terminal commands.
