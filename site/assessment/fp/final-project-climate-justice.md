# Project: Socio-economic vulnerability and climate risks
**Contact:** Theodoros Chatzivasileiadis


## Overview
A just transition to climate resilience is a crucial step in mitigating the adverse impacts of climate change and ensuring social equity in adaptation strategies. Climate justice emphasises the fair distribution of climate-related risks and benefits, recognizing that vulnerable communities often face disproportionate exposure to hazards like floods, heatwaves, and air pollution. While large-scale adaptation plans aim to enhance resilience globally, understanding the spatial distribution of climate risks and their intersection with socio-economic vulnerabilities is essential for promoting a fair and inclusive response. By identifying "hotspots" where climate risks and socio-economic disadvantages overlap, policymakers can design targeted interventions that prioritize equity, protect vulnerable groups, and support a more just transition for all. This project will challenge students to analyze **climate justice** by identifying and visualising spatial disparities in **climate risk exposure** and **socio-economic vulnerability**. Students will assess how climate hazards (such as floods, heatwaves, or air pollution) intersect with socio-economic factors (like income, race, and age) to produce disproportionate impacts on vulnerable communities. The final product will be a geospatial analysis, policy recommendations, and an interactive map highlighting areas where climate justice issues are most pressing.

## Objectives
1. **Identify Relevant Datasets and Research Questions**  
   - Search for open datasets and review relevant literature on climate justice, focusing on socio-economic factors, climate hazards, and environmental disparities.  
   - Develop clear, actionable research questions and hypotheses based on identified data gaps and societal challenges related to climate justice.  
   - Define a clear spatial focus (e.g., specific cities, regions, or countries) for examining climate vulnerabilities and risks.  
   - Critically evaluate the feasibility of the research questions and hypotheses given the available data and project scope.  
   - Clean, integrate, and prepare selected datasets (e.g., climate risk maps, demographic data) for analysis so they align with the intended research objectives and hypotheses.

2. **Analyze the Data**  
   - Explore and visualize spatial patterns of climate hazards (e.g., floods, heatwaves) and socio-economic vulnerabilities (e.g., income inequality, housing conditions) to identify trends and hotspots.  
   - Investigate relationships between exposure to climate-related risks and socio-economic indicators. Identify correlations or clusters that suggest environmental injustices or disproportionately affected communities.  
   - Employ spatial statistics, clustering, or regression methods to quantify and explain variations in climate risk exposure across different socio-economic groups.
   - Develop and train machine learning (ML) models to predict or classify characteristics related to climate vulnerability or hazard exposure (e.g., identifying which neighborhoods are most likely to face extreme heat events or flooding). Reflect critically on the major factors influencing these predictions, and rigorously evaluate the modelsâ€™ performance and reliability.


3. **Provide Actionable Insights for Policy Recommendations**  
   - Aggregate and compare results across regions, time periods, and socio-economic strata to understand the scale and scope of climate injustice.  
   - Estimate potential impacts of policy interventions on reducing vulnerabilities or improving resilience (e.g., infrastructure improvements, targeted subsidies, community-level mitigation strategies).  
   - Develop evidence-based policy recommendations that address observed disparities, enhance equity, and guide future climate adaptation and mitigation efforts.  
   - Revisit the initial research questions and hypotheses, directly linking findings to the stated objectives and discussing how the results inform ongoing dialogues and actions in the realm of climate justice.
