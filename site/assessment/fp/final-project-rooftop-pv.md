# Project: Feasibility and fairness of rooftop solar energy diffusion
**Contact:** Giacomo Marangoni

## Overview

A fast transition to renewable energy is a critical step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and keeping global warming below safe thresholds. Rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) energy offers a scalable, decentralized solution for harnessing solar power, a carbon neutral energy source. Although large techno-economic models assume a rapid scale-up of this technology throughout the globe, understanding the technical and spatial potential for rooftop solar installations across different geographical areas, combined with socio-economic and equity considerations, is essential for informing a feasible and fair transition.

## Objectives

1. **Identify relevant datasets and research questions**  
  - Search for open datasets and review relevant literature on rooftop solar deployment. Look for datasets that align with your research focus and assess their suitability for analysis.
  - Develop clear, actionable research questions and hypotheses based on gaps or opportunities identified in the literature, and relevant to the societal challenge mentioned in the introduction.
  - Define a clear and manageable spatial focus of analysis, whether it's specific cities, regions or countries.
  - Critically evaluate your research questions and hypotheses to ensure they are feasible given the scope of the project and the available data.
  - Prepare the selected datasets for analysis by cleaning, integrating, and transforming the data as needed to align with your research objectives and hypotheses.

2. **Analyze the data**  
  - Explore and visualize the distribution of solar potential and socio-economic data to identify spatial trends and patterns.
  - Investigate relationships between installed PV systems, spatial characteristics (e.g., solar irradiance, roof geometry), and socio-economic indicators (e.g., income, population density). Look for correlations or clusters that may reveal key insights in relation to your questions/hypotheses.
  - Develop and train machine learning (ML) models to predict or classify characteristics related to your analysis, e.g. suitability for PV installation, potential energy production, or likelihood of adoption. Reflect critically on the major factors driving these predictions and evaluate the model's performance and reliability.

3. **Provide actionable insights for policy recommendations**  
  - Aggregate and compare results across different regions, time periods, and/or socio-economic groups to identify disparities or inequities.
  - Calculate current and/or future societal impacts achievable through rooftop PV deployment, e.g. emissions reductions or air quality improvement. Consider economic implications as well (e.g. investment requirements).
  - Develop targeted policy recommendations to enhance the efficiency and equity of future rooftop PV deployment. Base these interventions on your findings, including enabling factors, barriers and disparities for rooftop PV adoption.
  - Revisit your original research questions and hypotheses, linking your findings to them directly. Reflect on how well the results address the initial objectives and what new questions might emerge.
