# Project: Vulnerability to weather disasters and public support for climate action
**Contact:** Adrien Poujon

## Overview

This project aims to investigate the relationship between how communities perceive and react to climate change and the specific vulnerabilities of those communities to disaster risks. The objective is to identify how local contexts -such as exposure to extreme weather events, wealth, and assets at risk- affect public attitudes toward climate change. By understanding these dynamics, we can inform the development of climate adaptation and mitigation policies that are both feasible and widely supported at the community level.

Public concern over climate change often rises in response to extreme weather events such as coastal floods, river floods, violent storms, droughts, wildfires and heatwaves. However, these reactions tend to be short-term. This project seeks to examine whether there is a more enduring link between public views on climate change and the vulnerability of their communities to disaster risks. This includes considering factors like the economic assets exposed to risk, the demographic profile of affected areas, and the overall wealth of the population.

## Objectives

1. **Identify relevant datasets and research questions**  
  - Search for open datasets and review relevant literature on extreme weather events and opinion on climate change. Look for datasets that align with your research focus and assess their suitability for analysis.
  - Develop clear, actionable research questions and hypotheses based on gaps or opportunities identified in the literature, and relevant to the societal challenge mentioned in the introduction.
  - Define a clear and manageable spatial focus of analysis, whether it's specific cities, regions or countries.
  - Critically evaluate your research questions and hypotheses to ensure they are feasible given the scope of the project and the available data.
  - Prepare the selected datasets for analysis by cleaning, integrating, and transforming the data as needed to align with your research objectives and hypotheses.

2. **Analyze the data**  
  - Explore and visualize the distribution of extreme weather event data to identify spatial trends and patterns.
  - Explore and visualize the distribution of public opinion data to identify spatial trends and patterns.
  - Investigate relationships between extreme weather events and public opinions on climate change, spatial characteristics (e.g., exposure to other weather events, frequency of extreme weather events, assets in the area), and socio-economic indicators (e.g., population density, income, cost of extreme weather events ...). Look for correlations or clusters that may reveal key insights in relation to your questions/hypotheses.
  - Develop and train machine learning (ML) models to predict or classify characteristics related to your analysis, e.g. support for climate action, concern about climate change. Reflect critically on the major factors driving these predictions and evaluate the model's performance and reliability.

3. **Provide actionable insights for policy recommendations**  
  - Aggregate and compare results across different regions, time periods, and/or socio-economic groups to identify disparities or inequities.
  - Explore the links between public support and exposure to past/future disaster events. Look at how this could foster rapid changes in public opinions.
  - Question how these insights should be taken into account when new policies are proposed and eventually implemented. Base these reflections on your findings and aim to address barriers or disparities highlighted in the analysis.
  - Revisit your original research questions and hypotheses, linking your findings to them directly. Reflect on how well the results address the initial objectives and what new questions might emerge.
