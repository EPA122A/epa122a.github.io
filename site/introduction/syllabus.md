# Syllabus

The course is divided into a set of interactive lectures and labs. Lectures are meant to provide students with concepts and theories. Labs are self-directed for practising programming in Python. Use this time to complete assignments in class with ample support from TAs.

## Overview of Course Contents

The *Spatial Data Science* course provides a structured journey through the key analytical, computational, and conceptual tools for understanding spatial and urban systems.
Students progress from core principles of data science and visualization to advanced spatial modeling, clustering, and density estimation techniques. The course blends lectures with applied labs in Python, developing hands-on skills in data wrangling, mapping, and machine learning.

### **1. Data Science**

* The power of data and its role in shaping evidence-based policy
* Introduction to geographic data science
* Main examples of spatial and urban data sources

### **2. Data Grammar**

* Cautionary perspectives on big data analytics
* Sustainable cities and ethical data use
* Data wrangling and cleaning with **Pandas**
* Feature scaling and transformation
* Introduction to machine learning fundamentals

### **3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualization**

* The *Grammar of Graphics*
* Visualization design principles
* Choosing appropriate chart types for spatial and non-spatial data

### **4. Geo-Visualization**

* Statistical mapping and spatial visualization techniques
* Communicating spatial patterns effectively through maps
* Color palettes and perception in geovisualization

### **5. Machine Learning I**

* Introduction to machine learning concepts
* Decision trees and linear regression
* Model tuning and the bias–variance tradeoff
* Anatomy of a learning algorithm

### **6. Machine Learning II**

* Deepening understanding of learning algorithms.

### **7. Clustering**

* Geodemographics and urban segmentation
* Understanding city structure through clustering
* Regionalization algorithms and spatial grouping methods

### **8. Dimensionality Reduction**

* Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and applications

### **9. Networks and Spatial Weights**

* Urban segregation and spatial structure
* Constructing and interpreting spatial weights
* Introduction to spatial regression frameworks

### **10. Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA)**

* Spatial autocorrelation and spatial dependence
* Quantitative geography and spatial inference

### **11. Spatial Density Estimation**

* Point pattern analysis
* Kernel density estimation and other spatial density techniques

### **12. Interpreting and Estimating Models**

* Model estimation and inference
* Statistical and spatial regression interpretation
* Understanding uncertainty and model limitations

### **13. Theo’s Case Study**

* Data science case study from climate adaptation research

### **14. Machine Learning for Climate Mitigation**

* Applications of machine learning for supporting climate mitigation policy-making

## Format

Seven weeks of:

- **2x 1h. Lectures**: concepts, methods, examples, crtiical discussions
- **2x 2h. Labs**: hands-on, application of concepts, Python
  (highly *employable*)
- **Further readings (optional!)**: how to go beyond this course

## Logistics

- **Course Material**: This website only!
- **Recordings of Lectures**: Lectures are not recorded and will take place in Den Haag.
- **Announcements, Submission + Feedback, Group Formation + Peer Review and Grading**: Brightspace

## Self-directed learning

- **Prepare** for the lectures and labs
- **I won't** be leading/lecturing at the computer labs. TAs will be present for abundant help and feedback
- **Go over the notebooks** before the lecture and the lab
- If the first time you see a notebook is at the lab, you may struggle to catch up. The best thing to do is to go over the notebooks at home and prepare a set of questions to ask the TAs.
- **Bring** questions, comments, feedback, (informed) rants to class/labs. The more you bring, the more we all learn.
- **Collaborate** (it's **NOT** a zero-sum game!!!)

## Assessment

The [assessments](../assessment_index.md) are composed of 3 `graded` components: two are **summative** (i.e. contribute to the final grade) and one is **formative** (i.e. does not contribute to the final grade):

* Formative Assignment (0%)
* Summative Group Final Project (50%)
* Summative Individual Computer-Based Exam (50%)
