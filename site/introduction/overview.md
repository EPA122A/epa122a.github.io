# Overview

## What is Spatial Data Science?

Spatial Data Science combines data analysis, geography, and computational methods to understand patterns and relationships that have a spatial dimension. From environmental monitoring to social research, spatial data helps reveal how location influences outcomes and decisions.

Recent advances in computing, open data, and machine learning have expanded what we can learn from spatial information. However, as data scientists, we must also consider the limitations and biases of data, and how analytical choices shape the knowledge we produce. Responsible spatial analysis means questioning data quality, representation, and impact, while striving to create insights that are transparent, reproducible, and fair.

## What is this course about?

This course introduces the full process of data-driven spatial analysis, from gathering and cleaning data to modeling and interpreting results. You will learn practical tools for exploring, visualizing, and analyzing spatial datasets while reflecting on their broader implications for research and policy.

Throughout the semester, we move from foundational data science concepts to more advanced spatial and machine learning techniques. You will start by learning how to obtain and clean data, then progress through exploratory data analysis, visualization, statistical and machine learning models, and finally the interpretation and communication of results. Labs and discussions will reinforce these skills through applied exercises and collaborative projects.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, you will be able to:

* Identify and evaluate appropriate data sources for a given problem.
* Clean, merge, and manage datasets from multiple origins.
* Explore and visualize data to uncover meaningful patterns.
* Apply statistical and machine learning models for analysis.
* Communicate results effectively through maps, graphics, and written interpretation.
