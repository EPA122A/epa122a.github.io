## Course Language

English & Python

## Why Python

* **General purpose** programming language
* "Sweet spot" between *"proof-of-concept"* and *"production-ready"*
* Industry standard: **Data Science** (World Bank, OECD, The Atlantic, Gemeente Den Haag...) and **GIS** (Esri, QGIS)

## Expected prior knowledge

Students should have some prior programming experience. It will be beneficial if you have dealt with a functional programming language like R or Python before. If you have never programmed, I recommend doing a crash course in Python through Coursera or other online services before joining the class. This course is not about learning how to program. It is about becoming responsible data scientists.

_Other faculties/universities:_ Graduate students from all faculties and exchange universities are welcome to join **[subject to me receiving an email with your motivation to join the course before the start of the course. Without receiving such a motivation email, we will not be able to accommodate you fully.]**. There are similar courses in other faculties that are also more tailored to your respective programs, in case this course is not what you were expecting it to be.

For students who have had statistical, math or computer programming courses in their bachelors or elsewhere, this course will add to your skills by providing you with tools to become future policy-makers, data scientists, and in general, supporters of open science. The course will offer some uncertainty in terms of what is a problem and how it can be solved. If you are willing to embrace that uncertainty, we will learn about the fundamentals of spatial data science. We may even discover new ways of designing equitable urban spaces, from neighbourhoods and cities to entire regions.

## Philosophy of the course

- (Lots of) **methods** and techniques
    - General overview
    - Intuition
    - Very little math
    - Lots of ways to continue on your own
- Emphasis on **critical thinking**, **application** and **use**
- Close connection to **real world** applications

Here’s an improved and more polished version of your **Feedback Strategy** section — clearer, better structured, and consistent with academic web style:

---

## Feedback Strategy

Students will receive feedback throughout the course through both **formative** and **summative** channels:

* **Formative Feedback**
  Ongoing feedback will be provided during **weekly lab sessions**, where students interact directly with the **teaching assistants and instructors**. General feedback on lab work will help identify areas for improvement.
  A **mid-term assignment** will also be given to provide comments on performance, including suggestions on how to improve ahead of the final assessments. This ensures students have the opportunity to **incorporate feedback into their summative work**.

* **Summative Feedback**
  Final, graded feedback will be provided based on two main assessments:

  1. A **group final project**, evaluating collaborative work across the full data science workflow.
  2. An **individual computer-based exam**, assessing individual understanding and technical proficiency.


## Questions

This course emphasizes **learning how to learn**. If you have questions or need clarification, please reach out using the following order of preference:

1. Ask **during class** discussions.
2. Bring your question to **lab sessions**.
3. Contact the **teaching assistants (TAs)** by email.
4. As a last resort, email the **professors** directly.

## Key texts and learning resources

Access to materials, including lecture slides and lab notebooks, is centralized through the use of a course website available through the following url:

[`https://epa122a.github.io`](https://epa122a.github.io)

References to additional material will be provided for each lecture and lab.
