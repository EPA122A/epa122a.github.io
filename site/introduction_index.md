## Course Language

English & Python

## Why Python

* **General purpose** programming language
* "Sweet spot" between *"proof-of-concept"* and *"production-ready"*
* Industry standard: **GIS** (Esri, QGIS) and **Data Science** (World Bank, OECD, The Atlantic, Gemeente Den Haag...)

## Expected prior knowledge

Students should have some prior programming experience. It will be beneficial if you have dealt with a functional programming language like R or Python before. If you have never programmed, I recommend doing a crash course in Python through Coursera or other online services before joining the class. This course is not about learning how to program. It is about becoming responsible data scientists.

_Other faculties/universities:_ Graduate students from all faculties and exchange universities are welcome to join **[subject to me receiving an email with your motivation to join the course before the start of the course. Without receiving such a motivation email, we will not be able to accommodate you fully.]**. There are similar courses in other faculties that are also more tailored to your respective programs, in case this course is not what you were expecting it to be.

For students who have had statistical, math or computer programming courses in their bachelors or elsewhere, this course will add to your skills by providing you with tools to become future policy-makers, data scientists, and in general, supporters of open science. The course will offer some uncertainty in terms of what is a problem and how it can be solved. If you are willing to embrace that uncertainty, we will learn about the fundamentals of spatial data science. We may even discover new ways of designing equitable urban spaces, from neighbourhoods and cities to entire regions.

## Philosophy of the course

- (Lots of) **methods** and techniques
    - General overview
    - Intuition
    - Very little math
    - Lots of ways to continue on your own
- Emphasis on **critical thinking**, **application** and **use**
- Close connection to **real world** applications

## Feedback strategy

The students will receive feedback through the following channels:

* **Formative Feedback** weekly general feedback on labs by TAs and direct interaction with the instructor and teaching assistants in the lectures and labs.
* **Summative Feedback** as graded assessment of three summative assignments and a final project. This will be in the form of reasoning of the mark assigned as well as comments specifying how the mark could be improved. This will be provided before the submission of the next assignment is due so students have the chance to incorporate the feedback in their work.

## Questions

This course is about learning to learn, so if you have a question, follow the process laid out below for the most efficient and organised way of learning.

## Key texts and learning resources

Access to materials, including lecture slides and lab notebooks, is centralized through the use of a course website available through the following url:

[`https://epa122a.github.io`](https://epa122a.github.io)

Specific readings, videos, and/or podcasts, as well as academic references will be provided for each lecture and lab, and can be accessed through the course website.
