# EPA122A - Spatial Data Science

Welcome to the GitHub repository for **EPA122A - Spatial Data Science**, a course offered at Delft University of Technology. This repository hosts the markdown files and other content that form the backbone of the course website, which contains all the important information and resources for the course.

## Course Overview

This course focuses on applying spatial data science techniques to real-world problems, particularly in urban areas. Students will learn how to gather, merge, and clean data from multiple sources, analyze spatial datasets, and communicate findings effectively. The course is structured around societal challenges such as climate change, energy transitions, and social inequalities, with an emphasis on using data science to inform policy and decision-making.

## Expected Prior Knowledge

- **Programming Experience**: Students are expected to have some prior programming experience. Familiarity with functional programming languages like **R** or **Python** will be beneficial.
- **Not for Beginners**: This course does not teach programming from scratch. If you have no prior experience, we recommend completing a Python crash course (e.g., via Coursera or other online platforms) before the course begins.
- **External Students**: If you are not a member of the TPM faculty but wish to join the course, please send a motivation email to the module manager before the course starts. Without this, we may not be able to fully accommodate your participation.

## Course Contents

The course is divided into five key modules, each reflecting a crucial phase in the lifecycle of a data science project:

1. **Obtain**: Learn to gather data from various open data sources.
2. **Scrub**: Clean, consolidate, and prepare the data for analysis.
3. **Explore**: Perform exploratory data analysis to uncover insights.
4. **Model**: Apply statistical and machine learning models for regression, classification, and clustering.
5. **Interpret**: Communicate findings through visualization, storytelling, and summary interpretation.

Students will work on a final project, synthesizing data to explore a problem of their choice, applying the five modules above to generate actionable insights and communicate their results in a written article.

## Course Structure

- **Lectures & Labs**: The course includes 8 hours of weekly engagement, with 2 hours of interactive lectures, 4 hours of labs, and 2 wildcard hours for additional activities.
- **Self-Study**: Attendance is not mandatory, but significant self-study is required. If you do not attend at least 4 hours weekly, you will need to dedicate additional time to keep up with the course.

## Study Goals

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Interpret and discuss data sources relevant to a given problem.
- Manipulate data to create informative, manageable datasets.
- Analyze and describe consolidated datasets to support problem-solving with evidence.
- Apply statistical and machine learning models to derive meaningful insights from data.
- Report findings through visualizations, storytelling, and concise summaries.

## Future Opportunities

Successful completion of this course will provide you with valuable skills applicable to policy-making, academia, responsible data science, and open science. You will be well-prepared for future data-driven roles or to approach new challenges with a critical and open mindset.
